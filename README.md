# AI-8-Puzzle-Solver
An 8 puzzle game solver using BFS, DFS, and A* search algorithms and there are two versions of the A* algorithm. One using the Manhattan Distance and the other is using the Euclidean Distance. 

## Run in terminal

- You will need to type the command 'python' followed by the python file, the initial puzzle list, and finally the algorithm to be used [bfs, dfs, am, ae].
```
[uname@hostname ~]$ python 8_puzzle.py '1,2,3,0,4,5,6,7,8' bfs
```

It has been tested with Python 3.6.
